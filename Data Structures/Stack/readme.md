        A stack (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the
        addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end.
        This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base".

        </br>
        For example, every web browser has a Back button. As you navigate
        from web page to web page, those pages are placed on a stack (actually it is the URLs that are
        going on the stack). The current page that you are viewing is on the top and the first page you
        looked at is at the base. If you click on the Back button, you begin to move in reverse order
        through the pages.

        <h2>Applications of Stack</h2>
        <ol>
         <li><strong>Interconversion ofpolish notations </strong></li>
         <br>
        There are three types of notations:
        <ul>
        <li>Infix notation - Operator is between the operands : x + y</li>
        <li>Prefix notation - Operator is before the operands : + xy</li> 
        <li>Postfix notation - Operator is after the operands : xy +</li>
       </ul>
       <br>
        <li> <strong>To reverse a string</strong></li>
        A string can be reversed by using stack. The characters of string pushed on to the stack till the end of the string. The characters are popped and displays. Since the end character of string is pushed at the last, it will be printed first. 
        <br>
        <br>
<li><strong>When function (sub-program) is called </strong></li> 
        When a function is called, the function is called last will be completed first. It is the property of stack. There is a memory area, specially reserved for this stack.
