A stack (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the
addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end.
This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base".

 For example, every web browser has a Back button. As you navigate
from web page to web page, those pages are placed on a stack (actually it is the URLs that are
going on the stack). The current page that you are viewing is on the top and the first page you
looked at is at the base. If you click on the Back button, you begin to move in reverse order
through the pages.+
